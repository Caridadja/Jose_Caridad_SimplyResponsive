        <p class="col sm-4 med-2 lg-1">CSS uses the @media rule to detect information about the device being used to
            access the website. For example, it can be used to detect the size of the device, its capabilities, and its
            orientation. For this course, we will be using it to detect the device size, but keep in mind that it is
            capable of much more.</p>
